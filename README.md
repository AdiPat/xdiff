# xDiff: Document Similarity Checker

## xDiff is a command line utility built in C++ for determining the percentage similarity between two text files using the Cosine Similarity Algorithm. I built this project just to brush up my knowledge of STL, so don't expect anything fancy here.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Install GNU make, a C++ compiler and fire up your terminal.

* **Compile the binary. It ain't gonna compile itself, my friend.**
```
make
```

* **Run the executable/binary**
```
./xdiff <path_to_file_1> <path_to_file_2>
```

* **Run Tests**: You can add custom text files to test in the tests/ folder. Modify `tests.cpp` as per your needs.
```
make test
./xdiff_test
```
